### The challenge

Quite an interesting challenge with a lot to learn. Yeah I must mention too, that it's quite twisted too, however, I enjoyed it.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Omo!!!!! I sha learnt a lot, but one remarkable stuff I learnt is the use of translate-(x or y). It was tough especially using it with tailwind for the first-time. I guess that is why we use google.

### Continued development

Tailwind is getting easier though but I think I still need to keep practicing. Solving more challenges will eventually get me there.

### Useful resources

Brad Traversy video on tailwind CSS help me navigate through the project, espcially with git commands, initially tailwind on the studio
